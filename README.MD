# Psychorama - Subliminal Forward Masking for Enhanced User Engagement

Psychorama is a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept that leverages the power of subliminal messaging through [forward masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_masking). By subtly influencing user perception, it primes users to be more receptive to specific keywords or messages within a web page. This technique is not only intriguing from a psychological perspective but also has practical applications in marketing and user engagement strategies.
